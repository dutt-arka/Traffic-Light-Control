The traffic congestion due to the exploding increase of vehicles became the severest social problems and it has a major effect on the economy of a country. Therefore, many researches about traffic light system have been done in order to overcome some complicated traffic phenomenon but existent research had been limited about present traffic system in well-travelled traffic scenarios.

Traffic lights are source of signalling device for road junctions. Traffic light controllers are programmed to assign timely directions to road users in Red, Yellow and Green. Present Traffic Light Controllers are based on microcontroller.TLC have limitations as it uses predefined hardware, which functions according to program that does not have flexibility of modification on real time basis.

To manage traffic flow, introduction of new technique ‘Dynamic Traffic Signal Controller’ emerged. Thus, optimization of traffic light switching; controls road capacity traffic flow and prevent congestions. The proposed system has simple architecture, ease of implementation and user friendliness.
